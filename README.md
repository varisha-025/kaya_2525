## Contribution Guidelines

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- Always create another branch and it should have a relevant name.
- When you make minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have too many commits for a very small fix.
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really great if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
